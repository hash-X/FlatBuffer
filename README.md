This is a FlatBuffer application which I will rewrite HDFS Namenode protobuf using in loadFSImage later (At here https://github.com/hash-X/hadoop/tree/LaterHadoopUseFlatBuffer). It's a new design and it's a memory efficient serialization Library. If you are interested in this project, Please contact with me.
